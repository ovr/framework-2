 * CacheItemInterface defines an interface for interacting with objects inside a cache.

 * CacheItemInterface defines an item inside a cache system.  Each Item object
 * MUST be associated with a specific key, which can be set according to the
 * implementing system and is typically passed by the Cache\PoolInterface object.
 *
 * The Cache\CacheItemInterface object encapsulates the storage and retrieval of
 * cache items. Each Cache\ItemInterface is generated by a Cache\PoolInterface
 * object, which is responsible for any required setup as well as associating
 * the object with a unique Key. Cache\ItemInterface objects MUST be able to
 * store and retrieve any type of PHP value defined in the Data section of this
 * document.
 *
 * Calling Libraries MUST NOT instantiate Item objects themselves. They may only
 * be requested from a Pool object via the getItem() method.  Calling Libraries
 * SHOULD NOT assume that an Item created by one Implementing Library is
 * compatible with a Pool from another Implementing Library.
